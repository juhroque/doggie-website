# Doggies website

Small React project to practice consuming APIs using fetch.

I'm using the free "https://api.thedogapi.com" to fetch the data!

## To do:

- [x] Fecth at least the breeds data
- [x] Random dog image button
- [x] Clean the code by separating the components into pages
- [ ] Custom hooks
- [ ] Better styling
- [ ] ... thinking!
